In this post, I write down my solutions for the [**OverTheWire wargames**](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). 

## Bandit

### 0

Just get used to the concept of `ssh`. `ssh` is *secure shell* which allows secured access to the remote machine from the local computer.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
 
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

# You will be asked to type in the password.
```

### 0 to 1

```{bash}
#| eval: false

# print out the file
cat readme

exit
 
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

# You will be asked to type in the password.
```

### 1 to 2

```{bash}
#| eval: false

# Special character - . Need to specify the full location of the file. 
cat ./-

```

### 2 to 3

```{bash}
#| eval: false

# enclose the filenames using double quote, or use \ before white space.

```

### 3 to 4

```{bash}
#| eval: false

# list all files using -a argument
ls inhere/ -a

```

### 4 to 5

```{bash}
#| eval: false

# find ASCII text files
# -exec file {} + executes the file command to get info on the content
find inhere -type f -exec file {} + | grep ASCII


```

### 5 to 6

```{bash}
#| eval: false

find inhere -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep ASCII
```

### 6 to 7

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# since we don't know where the file is, we will search from the root directory
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c -type f 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} \;

```

### 7 to 8

```{bash}
#| eval: false

grep -w "millionth" data.txt
```

### 8 to 9

```{bash}
#| eval: false

sort data.txt | uniq -u data.txt
```

### 9 to 10

```{bash}
#| eval: false

strings data.txt | grep "=="
```
