I had a chance to create a replication package for my coding assignment this fall. While doing the assignment, I decided to use this opportunity to actually implement a Dockerfile that will work for most of the platforms (e.g. macOC, Linux, ARM/AMD architecture). This is a post on my trial and error on building Docker image with Dockerfile.
