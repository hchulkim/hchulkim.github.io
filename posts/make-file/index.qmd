If you haven't used `Make` yet, you should do it now! `Make` is a software that can help your research worfklow by automating certain procedures. For example, you can use `Make` to re-run all your necessary codes whenever there is a change in the raw data in your folder.

Below I provide a very simple example of `Makefile` which is used to run `Make`. The code below checks all the folders that have git installed and can do `git pull` and `git push` for all the folders instead of manually going into the subfolders and run the command separately.

**ENJOY!**

```{bash}
#| eval: false
 
.PHONY: pull-all push-all

SUBDIRS := $(shell find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d)

pull-all:
	@for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
		if [ -d "$$dir/.git" ]; then \
			echo "Pulling in $$dir..."; \
			(cd $$dir && git pull); \
		else \
			echo "Skipping $$dir (not a git repo)"; \
		fi \
	done

push-all:
	@for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
		if [ -d "$$dir/.git" ]; then \
			echo "Pushing in $$dir..."; \
			(cd $$dir && git push); \
		else \
			echo "Skipping $$dir (not a git repo)"; \
		fi \
	done
