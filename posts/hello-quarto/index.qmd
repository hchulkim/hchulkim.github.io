Recently, I successfully migrated my website over to [Quarto](https://quarto.org). My past website using Hugo was not that bad but it was bit too glitchy for me. Luckily, I was able to learn that it was possible to make a website using Quarto. After some trial and error, I was able to set it up.

For me, migrating was not that painful as I did not have much information on my website. In fact, this was partially due to the fragility of my past website. For some reason, my website would sometimes go full <span style="color: red;">404</span> when I commit new info on my website. In order to solve this, I had to make some meaningless changes to re-commit my git repository. This problem does not seem to occur in Quarto. Finally, I will be able to actively use my Blog section. 

FYI, I will write down some words about the problems I faced when migrating. I was bit stuck when I had to type ` quarto publish gh-pages`. According to Quarto documentation, this code "will confirm that you want to publish, render your content, copy the output to a special `gh-pages` branch, push that branch to GitHub, and then open a browser to view your site once it is deployed." The problem was that my command will not go through in the deployment process. The deployment will go on forever. I googled it and one of the solution seems to just burn down the repo and re-initiate it. But I solved it by typing `quarto publish gh-pages --no-browser`. This is bit weird because Quarto documentation says you should use this option when you are publishing to a private website. While I don't think my website is a private one, this somehow made my command go through.

Also, I had to specify `gh-pages` branch manually in the repo settings in the github repository.
