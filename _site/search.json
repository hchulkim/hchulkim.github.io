    "text": "“The effect of remote working on household waste: Evidence from South Korea” with Hee-Seung Yang. Mar. 2025. [Working paper].\n\n\nAbstract\n\nRemote working, or Work-From-Home (WFH), is now one of the prevalent work arrangement around the world. However, its impact on the social welfare—such as waste generation—is largely unexplored. This paper examines the causal impact of remote working on household waste generation in South Korea using COVID-19 as a natural experiment. The findings reveal mixed results. While overall household waste in district remain unaffected, districts with higher WFH levels experience increased plastic and textile waste but decreased food waste. These results suggest that remote working may influence current consumption patterns and lifestyle. Understanding these environmental implications is crucial for promoting sustainable work models and responsible waste management in a digital and remote world.\n\n“The China shock and internal migration: Evidence from bilateral migration flows” with Jaerim Choi and Seung Hoon Lee. Mar. 2025. [Working paper]. Revise and Resubmit, Canadian Journal of Economics.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing Korean administrative datasets spanning almost two decades and covering nearly the entire bilateral internal migration flows between local labor markets, we identify the causal impact of the China trade shock on internal migration. The trade shock affects in-migration, but not out-migration. Separating further the China trade shock into export and import shocks, we find that export expansion increases in-migration, whereas import competition reduces in-migration. By decomposing the impact of trade shock into age groups, we find that effects of trade shocks in destination are robust and statistically significant across age groups; and most pronounced for middle-aged people between the ages of 45 and 64. Finally, households with male heads are more likely to be influenced by the trade shock compared to those with female heads, due to the greater reliance of the manufacturing sector on male labor."

    "text": "Recently, I successfully migrated my website over to Quarto. My past website using Hugo1 was not that bad but it was bit too glitchy for me. Luckily, I was able to learn that it was possible to make a website using Quarto. After some trial and error, I was able to set it up.\nFor me, migrating was not that painful as I did not have much information on my website. In fact, this was partially due to the fragility of my past website. For some reason, my website would sometimes go full 404 when I commit new info on my website. In order to solve this, I had to make some meaningless changes to re-commit my git repository. This problem does not seem to occur in Quarto. Finally, I will be able to actively use my Blog section.\nFYI, I will write down some words about the problems I faced when migrating. I was bit stuck when I had to type quarto publish gh-pages. According to Quarto documentation, this code “will confirm that you want to publish, render your content, copy the output to a special gh-pages branch, push that branch to GitHub, and then open a browser to view your site once it is deployed.” The problem was that my command will not go through in the deployment process. The deployment will go on forever. I googled it and one of the solutions seems to be that I need to delete my gh-pages branch and old deployment point to re-initiate it. But I solved it by typing quarto publish gh-pages --no-browser. This is bit weird because Quarto documentation says you should use this option when you are publishing to a private website. While I don’t think my website is a private one, this somehow made my command go through.\nAlso, I had to specify gh-pages branch manually in the repo settings in the github repository."

In essence, I believe one of the main reasons we do academic research is to share it with other scholars and expand the current literature. In that sense, citation is important because it is an indicator that verifies that your research is (at least marginally) helping other scholars.\nThus, it is an epsilon leap for the academia, but a giant leap for myself."

Just having more data will not solve your problem. In order to identify the parameter of interest, we need economic theory to guide us."

    "section": "Hemi-continuity and fixed point theorem",
    "text": "Hemi-continuity and fixed point theorem\nWhen I was first learned about hemi-continuity in math camp, I was not sure why we need to know this concept. The only intuition I had was that it is sort of a generalization of the continuity definition to correspondence. But after taking the game theory course, I finally realized that we need this condition to apply Kakutani fixed point theorem. FYI, we need kakutani fixed point theorem to prove that Nash eqm exists.\n\nEx-ante, interim, ex-post\nWhen talking about (expected) payoff of agents, it is important to know whether the agents are maximizing ex-ante, interim, or ex-post. For example, revenue equivalence theorem in auction is about equivalence of autioneer’s expected payoff ex-ante, not ex-post. Fortunately, chatgpt did a good job in summarizing the definition in a table.\n\n\n\nNormal form and extensive form\nIt is important to note that the main difference between normal form game and extensive form game is not the timing. That is, fundamental difference between normal form and extensive form game is not whether the agents make decisions at the same time or not. For example, think of a game where agents makes decisions at different timing but they cannot observe others’ actions. In this setting, the game is still a normal form. The game becomes “extensive” when some agents can observe other agents’ actions before making their own decisions. Thus, the main factor that differentiates normal form and extensive form is whether agents make their actions after observing other’s actions.\n\n\nAdverse selection\nI thought it was interesting to learn that the key takeaway from adverse selection isn’t just the presence of information asymmetry between agents, but that this asymmetry impacts other agents’ payoffs. In fact, this is the main factor leading to the presence of adverse selection. In the famous lemon market example, adverse selection will not occur if there were separate and independent dimensions of utility for the seller and buyer.\n\n\nRevenue equivalence theorem\nAlthough I learned this concept in undergraduate micro class, it was still very cool to know that ex-ante expected revenue becomes equivalent for all standard auction games."

    "text": "IMPORTANT: Summer in Korea is very hot and humid! When planning outdoor activities make sure you check out the weather beforehand. Fortunately, most buildings in Korea have ACs so try to stay indoor a lot during the summer.\nIn general, “information friction” seems to be quite low in South Korea. That being said, be aware that popular places that you search for on the internet will be quite crowded. Do expect some queue lines and make sure you consider the tradeoff of visiting a nice place and spending lot of time in the queue (But also take into account that most good places will have large volume of people on average. So you will need to wait in most places you want to visit).\nMaps: Like many other East Asia countries, lot of systems in Korea are country-specific (unfortunately). If you tend to travel in Korea, I strongly recommend you download either “Naver map” or “Kakao map” on your phone. They are the google map equivalent app in Seoul. Note that google map will not work very well in Korea.\nTransportation card: Unfortunately, you cannot use your regular credit cards to pay for the public transportation. You will have to buy some pre-paid card. For short-term trips, you can buy them at the station. I recommend you try out Climate card which is a relatively new pre-paid pass card that came out in Seoul. Also, remember to TAP IN and TAP OUT on both buses and subways!\nOrdering in restaurant: In Korea, there is no tip culture. That being said, no servers are assigned to your table (like in US). So do not passively wait for them to come get your order. In Korea, you can just call the server by raising your hand and calling out “excuse me”. This is not considered impolite and you will see that many people do that. Otherwise, they are not going to periodically check on you. Also, unlike other countries, you don’t pay the bill in your table. When you are done eating, just go to the counter and pay for the meal.\nPublic safety: I would say Seoul is one of the most safe cities in the world(in terms of traveling). You don’t need to worry too much about where you are going (within Seoul, it will be very unlikely that you stumble into some dangerous regions) and you can walk around at night. Many people will just walk around Seoul at 2, 3am and it would be fine.\nDrinking: One nice thing about Korea’s drinking culture is that you can drink your bottle outside. I would suggest you take some night-time picnic to Hangang river with some drinks. There are lot of parks near the river where you will see people drinking and enjoying the view.\nBicycle: Seoul also has public bicycle system. I didn’t try it often but I heard it’s pretty good. But warning: Unlike US or European countries, there are not many lanes strictly designated to bicycle in Korea. Also, it is bit rare for bicycle to go on the same road with the cars. In fact, it will be more common to just ride the bicycle in the pedestrian way. So when traveling in bicycle, just use the pedestrian way and be careful of the people. You should also keep an eye on the street for bicycle as you walk."

    "text": "IMPORTANT: Summer in Korea is very hot and humid! When planning outdoor activities make sure you check out the weather beforehand. Fortunately, most buildings in Korea have ACs so try to stay indoor a lot during the summer.\nIn general, “information friction” seems to be quite low in South Korea. That being said, be aware that popular places that you search for on the internet will be quite crowded. Do expect some queue lines and make sure you consider the tradeoff of visiting a nice place and spending lot of time in the queue (But also take into account that most good places will have large volume of people on average. So you will need to wait in most places you want to visit).\nMaps: Like many other East Asia countries, lot of systems in Korea are country-specific (unfortunately). If you tend to travel in Korea, I strongly recommend you download either “Naver map” or “Kakao map” on your phone. They are the google map equivalent app in Seoul. Note that google map will not work very well in Korea.\nTransportation card: Unfortunately, you cannot use your regular credit cards to pay for the public transportation. You will have to buy some pre-paid card. For short-term trips, you can buy them at the station. I recommend you try out Climate card which is a relatively new pre-paid pass card that came out in Seoul. Also, remember to TAP IN and TAP OUT on both buses and subways!\nOrdering in restaurant: In Korea, there is no tip culture. That being said, no servers are assigned to your table (like in US). So do not passively wait for them to come get your order. In Korea, you can just call the server by raising your hand and calling out “excuse me”. This is not considered impolite and you will see that many people do that. Otherwise, they are not going to periodically check on you. Also, unlike other countries, you don’t pay the bill in your table. When you are done eating, just go to the counter and pay for the meal.\nPublic safety: I would say Seoul is one of the most safe cities in the world(in terms of traveling). You don’t need to worry too much about where you are going (within Seoul, it will be very unlikely that you stumble into some dangerous regions) and you can walk around at night. Many people will just walk around Seoul at 2, 3am and it would be fine.\nDrinking: One nice thing about Korea’s drinking culture is that you can drink your bottle outside.

    "text": "Transportation tips\n\nAirport to Seoul (bus): There are few ways to go from Incheon international airport to Seoul. Easiest way (but little bit more expensive) is airport bus (a.k.a. limousine bus). You can buy the ticket in the airport and they cover most major places in Seoul. You can also use the subway although I have never tried it.\nTransportation within Seoul (bus and subway): If you stay in Seoul, you will be able to access most (to be honest, all) locations in the city using public transportation. Main transportation is “bus” and “subway.” Another advantage of Seoul is that bus and subway system are very well interconnected. You only pay by the distance (even the rate of increment for distance is pretty generous within Seoul) and transferring to other bus or subway do not have extra cost (except very few subway or system run by different region). Arrival rates are also pretty good so make sure you use it a lot.\nTransportation at night (taxi): That being said, you won’t need to use other transportation within Seoul unless you are moving very late at night. Lot of subways and buses stop working around 11pm~12am-ish. If you tend to stay far away from your home at night, you will have to use taxi. You can get a taxi either by catching them on the go or by app (sth like kakao taxi). Just be warned that it is bit harder to catch taxi at night as there are less supply."

    "text": "Brief personal recommendations\n\nPlaces around “seoul forest” are quite nice. The park is very nice with small pond and place near the park (Seongsu-dong) has sort of New York Brooklyn vibe(shameless comparison, I know…). Just be aware that there tends to be lot of people around.\nTry out places around the old city. These places are generally called “within four doors.” This is because in the past, the Seoul walled city had four main doors for entry. Unlike other places in Seoul which are now pretty modern, old city area still has lot of traditional places. Try out some traditional Korean house villages (like Bukchon Hanok Village and Seochon). I personally like area around Seochon. They are also close to the palaces so you will be able to visit them as well. Overall, area around the palaces (Seochon or Bukchon are all places surrounding the old palaces) are generally nice place to walk around.\nWalking along the river is nice. Especially try out Cheong-gye-cheon stream at night. Having a night picnic near Han-gang river is also a nice experience.\nIf you like theme parks, be sure to try out Lotte World Adventure. It used to be the biggest In-door Theme park until 2010. It is also known for having many dark rides. It is also close to shopping mall (Lotte mall is right next to it) and Lotte World Tower which is currenlty the tallest building in Korea.1\n\n\nTry out some traditional markets: Places like Gwang-jang market or Tong-in market are very interesting places to go and eat some snack foods.\nIf you have time, you could go to Sinchon which has university (Yonsei University) I am from. Although it is not as fancy as universities in Europe or US, it is overall clean and nice. Even though place is bit dying now, Sinchon is also known as one of the popular places for university students. You will be able to feel some freshman(?) vibe.2\n\n\nAlthough not my favorite, I guess you will probably be visiting Gangnam at least once when you are in Seoul. It is sort of like SOHO in UK. I do think it is a bit tourist-trap place but it does have some nice restaurants and places.\nIf you are a “park person”, try out Olympic park. It is also pretty close to Seok-chon lake which is also a famous place for a walk. But note that the place might be packed with people depending on when you go.\nKorea also has some nice coffee shops so try them. Good thing about cafes in Korea is that it is very convenient to work (e.g. using laptop). Lot of coffee shops in Korea have large tables and power outlets around."

    "text": "Personal food recommendations\n\nKorean BBQ: I think Korean BBQ is now quite popular even outside of Korea. Big advantage of eating Korean BBQ in Korea is that it is relatively cheaper. If you have time, try places like “ha-nam pig house”, “Go-ban sik-dang”, “byeok-je kalbi”, etc.\nKorean fried chicken: Korean fried chicken is very tasty. There are many places (e.g. BBQ chicken, BHC chicken, etc) you can get it from and they all have their own specialties. I recommend you get a take-out and eat it near Han-gang river with some beer.\nCold noodles (e.g. Pyeong-yang Neng-myeon): Korea also has nice cold noodles. Peyong-yang Neng-myeon is my favorite but opinions are divided (some people don’t like it because it tastes quite bland). Try places like “ure-ok”, “bong-phee-yang”, “ul-ji-myeon-ok”, “ul-mil-dae”. Other than Pyeong-yang Neng-myeon, bean noodle is also a nice choice. It is basically noodle served in a soup made from grinding beans.\nTraditional Korean foods: Very interesting thing about Korean food is that"
