    "text": "“The effect of remote working on household waste: Evidence from South Korea” with Hee-Seung Yang. Mar. 2025. [Working paper].\n\n\nAbstract\n\nRemote working, or Work-From-Home (WFH), is now one of the prevalent work arrangement around the world. However, its impact on the social welfare—such as waste generation—is largely unexplored. This paper examines the causal impact of remote working on household waste generation in South Korea using COVID-19 as a natural experiment. The findings reveal mixed results. While overall household waste in district remain unaffected, districts with higher WFH levels experience increased plastic and textile waste but decreased food waste. These results suggest that remote working may influence current consumption patterns and lifestyle. Understanding these environmental implications is crucial for promoting sustainable work models and responsible waste management in a digital and remote world.\n\n“The China shock and internal migration: Evidence from bilateral migration flows” with Jaerim Choi and Seung Hoon Lee. Mar. 2024. [Working paper].\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing Korean administrative datasets spanning almost two decades and covering nearly the entire bilateral internal migration flows between local labor markets, we identify the causal impact of the China trade shock on internal migration. The trade shock affects in-migration, but not out-migration. Separating further the China trade shock into export and import shocks, we find that export expansion increases in-migration, whereas import competition reduces in-migration. By decomposing the impact of trade shock into age groups, we find that effects of trade shocks in destination are robust and statistically significant across age groups; and most pronounced for middle-aged people between the ages of 45 and 64. Finally, households with male heads are more likely to be influenced by the trade shock compared to those with female heads, due to the greater reliance of the manufacturing sector on male labor."

    "text": "Recently, I successfully migrated my website over to Quarto. My past website using Hugo1 was not that bad but it was bit too glitchy for me. Luckily, I was able to learn that it was possible to make a website using Quarto. After some trial and error, I was able to set it up.\nFor me, migrating was not that painful as I did not have much information on my website. In fact, this was partially due to the fragility of my past website. For some reason, my website would sometimes go full 404 when I commit new info on my website. In order to solve this, I had to make some meaningless changes to re-commit my git repository. This problem does not seem to occur in Quarto. Finally, I will be able to actively use my Blog section.\nFYI, I will write down some words about the problems I faced when migrating. I was bit stuck when I had to type quarto publish gh-pages. According to Quarto documentation, this code “will confirm that you want to publish, render your content, copy the output to a special gh-pages branch, push that branch to GitHub, and then open a browser to view your site once it is deployed.” The problem was that my command will not go through in the deployment process. The deployment will go on forever. I googled it and one of the solutions seems to be that I need to delete my gh-pages branch and old deployment point to re-initiate it. But I solved it by typing quarto publish gh-pages --no-browser. This is bit weird because Quarto documentation says you should use this option when you are publishing to a private website. While I don’t think my website is a private one, this somehow made my command go through.\nAlso, I had to specify gh-pages branch manually in the repo settings in the github repository."
