  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Using Korean administrative data spanning nearly two decades and covering the universe of bilateral migration flows across local labor markets, we examine how the China trade shock shapes internal migration. While prior studies rely on net population changes to measure labor adjustment, we exploit bilateral migration flows that separately capture in- and out-migration. We find that trade exposure primarily increases out-migration from adversely affected regions, with limited effects on in-migration, revealing asymmetric spatial adjustment. Decomposing the shock, export expansion reduces out-migration, whereas import competition increases it. Migration responses are strongest among prime working-age individuals and substantially weaker among younger and older cohorts. Single-person households are more responsive than multi-person households. Overall, bilateral data reveal substantial migration responses that conventional net population measures fail to detect, offering new insight into the "missing migration puzzle."

"The effect of remote working on household waste: evidence from South Korea" with [Hee-Seung Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/heeseungyang/home). Mar. 2025. [\[Working paper\]](working-paper/wfh-waste.pdf).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote working, or Work-From-Home (WFH), is now one of the prevalent work arrangement around the world. However, its impact on the social welfare---such as waste generation---is largely unexplored. This paper examines the causal impact of remote working on household waste generation in South Korea using COVID-19 as a natural experiment. The findings reveal mixed results. While overall household waste in district remain unaffected, districts with higher WFH levels experience increased plastic and textile waste but decreased food waste. These results suggest that remote working may influence current consumption patterns and lifestyle. Understanding these environmental implications is crucial for promoting sustainable work models and responsible waste management in a digital and remote world.
