  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Using Korean administrative data spanning nearly two decades and covering the universe of bilateral migration flows across local labor markets, we examine how the China trade shock shapes internal migration. We find that trade exposure significantly increases out-migration from adversely affected regions, while its effect on in-migration to destination regions is comparatively limited, indicating asymmetric spatial adjustment. Decomposing the shock, export expansion reduces out-migration from exposed local labor markets, whereas import competition induces greater outward mobility. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that migration responses are most pronounced among prime working-age individuals, with substantially weaker mobility among younger and older cohorts. Moreover, single-person households are markedly more responsive to trade-induced shocks than multi-person households, underscoring the role of household structure in shaping labor mobility. Overall, our findings highlight internal migration as an important but uneven adjustment margin to trade shocks.

"The effect of remote working on household waste: evidence from South Korea" with [Hee-Seung Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/heeseungyang/home). Mar. 2025. [\[Working paper\]](working-paper/wfh-waste.pdf).

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote working, or Work-From-Home (WFH), is now one of the prevalent work arrangement around the world. However, its impact on the social welfare---such as waste generation---is largely unexplored. This paper examines the causal impact of remote working on household waste generation in South Korea using COVID-19 as a natural experiment. The findings reveal mixed results. While overall household waste in district remain unaffected, districts with higher WFH levels experience increased plastic and textile waste but decreased food waste. These results suggest that remote working may influence current consumption patterns and lifestyle. Understanding these environmental implications is crucial for promoting sustainable work models and responsible waste management in a digital and remote world.
