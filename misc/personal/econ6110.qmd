This is an informal note to record what I thought about or what I thought was important in the Game theory class.

### Ex-ante, interim, ex-post

When talking about (expected) payoff of agents, it is important to know whether the agents are maximizing ex-ante, interim, or ex-post. For example, revenue equivalence theorem in auction is about equivalence of autioneer's expected payoff ex-ante, not ex-post. Fortunately, chatgpt did a good job in summarizing the definition in a table.

### Normal form and extensive form

It is important to note that the main difference between normal form game and extensive form game is not the timing. That is, fundamental difference between normal form and extensive form game is not whether the agents make decisions at the same time or not. For example, think of a game where agents makes decisions at different timing but they cannot observe others' actions. In this setting, the game is still a normal form. The game becomes "extensive" when some agents can observe other agents' actions before making their own decisions. Thus, the main factor that differentiates normal form and extensive form is whether agents make their actions after observing other's actions.

### Adverse selection

I thought it was interesting to learn that the key takeaway from **adverse selection** isn't just the presence of information asymmetry between agents, but that this asymmetry impacts other agents' payoffs. In fact, this is the main factor leading to the presence of adverse selection. In the famous lemon market example, adverse selection will not occur if there were separate and independent dimensions of utility for the seller and buyer.
