This is an informal notes to record what I thought about or what I thought was important in the Game theory class.

### Adverse selection

I thought it was interesting to learn that the key takeaway from **adverse selection** isn't just the presence of information asymmetry between agents, but that this asymmetry impacts other agents' payoffs. In fact, this is the main factor leading to the presence of adverse selection. In the famous lemon market example, adverse selection will not occur if there were separate and independent dimensions of utility for the seller and buyer.
